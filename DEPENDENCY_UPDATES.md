### Attempted but Reverted

#### Zod v3 → v4 (Attempted)
- **Status**: Attempted but reverted due to ecosystem compatibility
- **Issue**: @conform-to/zod library incompatibility with Zod v4
- **Reason**: ZodEffects renamed to ZodTransform in v4, breaking third-party libraries

## Known Issues

### Remaining Security Vulnerability
- **Package**: esbuild (≤0.24.2) 
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Impact**: Development server only (not production)
- **Source**: Indirect dependency via drizzle-kit
- **Resolution**: Requires drizzle-kit upgrade which may introduce breaking changes

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Dependencies Updated**: 100+
- **Major Version Upgrades**: 5 successful
- **Security Vulnerabilities Fixed**: 3/4 (75%)
- **Build Status**: ✅ Passing
- **TypeScript Compilation**: ✅ Passing
- **Breaking Changes Handled**: All successfully resolved

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Zod v4**: Watch for @conform-to/zod updates that support Zod v4
2. **Drizzle Migration**: Plan future upgrade of drizzle-kit to resolve esbuild vulnerability
3. **Regular Updates**: Establish monthly dependency update schedule
4. **Security Monitoring**: Continue monitoring npm audit for new vulnerabilities

# Implementation Plan: Features with Sub-Features

**Date:** June 12, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement a hierarchical feature system, allowing features to have sub-features. This will enable more granular organization and management of product features within the application, creating a tree-like structure.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Users must be able to create a new feature as a sub-feature of an existing feature.
- Users must be able to create top-level features (features without a parent).
- The system must support multiple levels of nesting for sub-features (e.g., Feature -> Sub-Feature -> Sub-Sub-Feature).
- Users must be able to view features and their sub-features in a clear hierarchical structure (e.g., indented list, tree view).
- Users must be able to edit the details of any feature or sub-feature.
- Users must be able to change the parent of a sub-feature, or move a sub-feature to become a top-level feature.
- Users must be able to delete features and sub-features.
- If a parent feature is deleted, all its descendant sub-features must also be deleted (cascading delete).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- The system should handle queries for hierarchical feature data efficiently.
- The UI for managing hierarchical features should be intuitive and user-friendly.
- Data integrity must be maintained (e.g., preventing circular dependencies).

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Modification

- **Identify Feature Table:** Locate the existing table for features (e.g., `features`). If one doesn't exist, it will need to be created.
- **Add `parent_feature_id` Column:**
  - Type: Foreign Key, referencing the primary key of the same `features` table.
  - Nullable: True (to allow for top-level features).
  - Constraint: `ON DELETE CASCADE` to ensure sub-features are deleted when a parent is deleted.
- **Add Index:** Create an index on `parent_feature_id` for performance.
- **(Optional) Consider `depth` or `materialized_path` columns:** For optimizing queries on deep hierarchies. Evaluate necessity based on expected depth and query patterns.
- **Create Drizzle Migration:** Generate and apply a database migration script for these changes.

### Step 2: Backend API Development

- **Update Feature Model/Entity:**
  - Reflect the new `parent_feature_id` field.
  - Potentially add a way to represent child features (e.g., a `subFeatures` list, though this might be handled at the service layer).
- **Update Feature Services/Logic:**
  - Modify logic for creating features to accept an optional `parent_feature_id`.
  - Implement logic to prevent circular dependencies (e.g., a feature cannot be its own descendant).
  - Update logic for deleting features to handle cascading deletes correctly (if not fully handled by DB constraints).
  - Implement logic for updating a feature's parent.
- **Update API Endpoints (e.g., `/api/features`):**
  - **`POST /api/features` (Create):**
    - Modify request body to accept `parent_feature_id`.
  - **`GET /api/features` (List):**
    - Determine strategy for returning hierarchical data:
      - Option A: Return a flat list, with `parent_feature_id` allowing clients to reconstruct the hierarchy.
      - Option B: Return a nested structure (can be complex for deep hierarchies and pagination).
      - Option C: Provide specific endpoints for fetching children of a feature.
    - Consider query parameters for fetching top-level features or features at a specific depth.
  - **`GET /api/features/{id}` (Retrieve):**
    - Return the feature along with its direct sub-features, or information about its parent.
  - **`PUT /api/features/{id}` (Update):**
    - Allow updating `parent_feature_id` (moving the feature).
    - Ensure validation against circular dependencies.
  - **`DELETE /api/features/{id}` (Delete):**
    - Ensure cascading delete of sub-features is triggered.

### Step 3: Frontend UI/UX Development

- **Feature Display:**
  - Update lists where features are displayed (e.g., `ListView`, `DataTable`, sidebars) to show the hierarchy.
    - Use indentation, tree-view components, or expand/collapse icons.
  - Update breadcrumbs or navigation elements to reflect the feature hierarchy.
- **Feature Creation/Editing Form:**
  - Add a "Parent Feature" selector (e.g., using `ComboboxSingle` or similar) to the feature creation/edit form. This selector should allow users to choose an existing feature as the parent or select no parent for a top-level feature.
  - Ensure the selector prevents selecting the feature itself or its descendants as a parent.
- **"Add Sub-feature" Functionality:**
  - Provide a context-sensitive action (e.g., a button or menu item on a feature) to directly create a sub-feature under it.
- **Deletion Confirmation:**
  - When deleting a feature with sub-features, clearly inform the user that all sub-features will also be deleted.

### Step 4: Data Migration (If Applicable)

- If existing features need to be integrated into the new hierarchy (e.g., all current features become top-level), plan and script this migration.

## 4. Testing

### Unit Tests

- Test backend model logic for parent-child relationships.
- Test validation logic (e.g., circular dependency prevention).
- Test API endpoint handlers for all CRUD operations, including parenting and hierarchy aspects.
- Test service layer logic for feature manipulation.

### Integration Tests

- Test API-to-database interactions for hierarchical operations.
- Verify cascading deletes and parent updates at the database level through API calls.

### End-to-End (E2E) Tests (using Playwright)

- **Scenario 1: Create Hierarchy:**
  - User creates Feature A (top-level).
  - User creates Sub-Feature B under Feature A.
  - User creates Sub-Sub-Feature C under Sub-Feature B.
  - Verify correct display of hierarchy.
- **Scenario 2: Edit Feature:**
  - User edits the name of Sub-Feature B.
  - Verify change is reflected.
- **Scenario 3: Move Feature:**
  - User creates Feature D (top-level).
  - User moves Sub-Feature B from under Feature A to under Feature D.
  - Verify updated hierarchy.
- **Scenario 4: Delete Sub-Feature:**
  - User deletes Sub-Sub-Feature C.
  - Verify it's removed and Sub-Feature B remains.
- **Scenario 5: Delete Parent Feature:**
  - User deletes Feature A.
  - Verify Feature A and all its descendants (if any were re-parented there) are deleted.
- **Scenario 6: Prevent Circular Dependency:**
  - Attempt to set Feature A as a child of Sub-Feature B (which is already a child of A).
  - Verify the operation is disallowed with a clear error message.

## 5. Assumptions

- An existing "Feature" entity and corresponding management interface (API, UI) are in place.
- The application uses Drizzle ORM and a relational database that supports foreign keys and cascading deletes.
- The primary identifier for features is a single key (e.g., `id`).
- A clear definition of "feature" exists within the application's domain.
- The maximum depth of the hierarchy is not excessively large to the point of causing significant performance or UX issues with typical tree traversal algorithms. If very deep hierarchies are expected, further optimization strategies (like materialized paths) will be critical.
- Deleting a parent feature should always delete its children. Alternative behaviors (like orphaning or re-parenting to a default) are not in scope for this iteration unless specified.

## 6. Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk 1: Performance Degradation:** Complex queries for deeply nested features might slow down API responses or UI rendering.
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Implement efficient database queries (e.g., recursive CTEs if needed, though often direct parent/child lookups are sufficient for many operations).
    - Ensure proper indexing on `parent_feature_id`.
    - Consider pagination and lazy loading for displaying large hierarchies in the UI.
    - If necessary, denormalize data by adding `depth` or `materialized_path` columns for optimized subtree queries.
- **Risk 2: Circular Dependencies:** Users might inadvertently (or intentionally) try to create loops in the feature hierarchy (e.g., Feature A is parent of B, B is parent of C, and C is parent of A).
  - **Mitigation:** Implement robust server-side validation to detect and prevent such operations during feature creation and parent updates.
- **Risk 3: User Experience Complexity:** Managing deeply nested hierarchies can become confusing for users.
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Design an intuitive and clear UI for visualizing and navigating the tree structure (e.g., clear indentation, expand/collapse functionality).
    - Provide good visual feedback for operations like moving or re-parenting features.
    - Consider if a practical limit on nesting depth should be advised or enforced.
- **Risk 4: Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect implementation of cascading deletes or parent updates could lead to orphaned records or inconsistent data.
  - **Mitigation:**
    - Rely on database-level foreign key constraints (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) where possible.
    - Thoroughly test all operations that modify the hierarchy.
    - Implement comprehensive logging for critical operations.
- **Risk 5: Scope Creep:** Requests for advanced hierarchical management features (e.g., bulk operations, complex reordering within a level) might arise.
  - **Mitigation:** Clearly define the scope for the initial implementation and defer advanced features to future iterations.

## 7. Impact Analysis

- **Database:**
  - Schema change to the `features` table (or equivalent).
  - Potential for data migration if existing features need to be adapted.
- **Backend:**
  - Significant modifications to feature-related models, services, and API endpoints.
  - Business logic changes to handle hierarchical relationships.
- **Frontend:**
  - Substantial UI changes in all areas where features are displayed, created, or managed.
  - Components like lists, forms, and navigation elements will require updates.
- **Performance:**
  - Feature retrieval queries may become more complex. Monitoring and optimization will be necessary.
- **Existing Functionality:**
  - Any system component that consumes or interacts with feature data (e.g., reporting, search, dashboards, project views) will need to be updated to understand and correctly process the new hierarchical structure.
- **User Workflow:**
  - Users will have new capabilities for organizing features, which may require updates to user documentation and potentially training.
- **Testing:**
  - Existing tests for feature management will need to be updated or rewritten. New test cases for hierarchical aspects are required.

## 8. Data Model Changes (Conceptual - Drizzle Example)

Assuming a `features` table managed by Drizzle:

```typescript
// Example: db/schema/features.ts (or similar)
import { serial, text, pgTable, integer, timestamp } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core'

export const features = pgTable('features', {
	id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
	name: text('name').notNull(),
	description: text('description'),
	// ... other existing feature columns

	// New column for hierarchy
	parentFeatureId: integer('parent_feature_id').references(
		(): AnyPgColumn => features.id,
		{ onDelete: 'cascade' },
	),

	createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
	updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at').defaultNow(),
})

// It's good practice to also define relations if using Drizzle's relational queries
// export const featureRelations = relations(features, ({one, many}) => ({
//   parentFeature: one(features, {
//     fields: [features.parentFeatureId],
//     references: [features.id],
//     relationName: 'parentFeature',
//   }),
//   subFeatures: many(features, {
//     relationName: 'parentFeature', // Drizzle uses relationName to link back
//   }),
// }));
```

Migration File (Conceptual - generated by Drizzle Kit): A new migration file will be generated by drizzle-kit generate:pg which will include SQL to:
Add the parent_feature_id column to the features table.
Add the foreign key constraint with ON DELETE CASCADE.
Create an index on parent_feature_id. 9. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX) Considerations
Hierarchy Visualization:
Employ a tree view or an indented list for displaying features.
Use clear visual cues (e.g., icons like > or ▼ for expand/collapse, lines connecting parent-child) to indicate nesting and parent-child relationships.
Ensure good readability and scannability, especially for deeper hierarchies.
Creation of Sub-features:
Inline Creation: Allow creating a sub-feature directly from a parent feature's context menu or detail view (e.g., "Add sub-feature" button).
Form-based Creation: The main feature creation form should include an optional "Parent Feature" field (e.g., a searchable dropdown/combobox).
Editing and Moving Features:
The feature edit form should allow changing the "Parent Feature", effectively moving the feature within the hierarchy or making it a top-level feature.
Consider drag-and-drop functionality for reordering and re-parenting within a tree view as a future enhancement for improved UX.
Navigation:
Breadcrumbs should accurately reflect the path if a user navigates into a deeply nested feature's detail view.
Feedback and Confirmation:
Provide clear visual feedback for actions like creating, moving, or deleting features within the hierarchy.
Deletion of a parent feature should have a prominent confirmation dialog explaining that all sub-features will also be deleted.
Performance in UI:
For very large hierarchies, implement lazy loading of sub-features to prevent UI freezes.
Optimize rendering of tree/list components. 10. Dependencies
Internal Dependencies:
Existing Feature Module: The core logic for managing features (models, services, API in models, routes, etc.).
UI Components:
List/Table components (e.g., data-table.tsx, list-view.tsx).
Form components (e.g., forms.tsx, form-fields-builder.tsx).
Selector/Combobox components (e.g., combobox-single.tsx).
Navigation components (e.g., admin-sidebar-nav.tsx, breadcrumbs.tsx).
Database ORM: Drizzle ORM (as indicated by drizzle.config.ts, schema).
Authentication/Authorization System: Ensure that permissions for managing features are correctly applied to sub-features.
External Dependencies:
None anticipated for the core logic, unless a third-party UI library for advanced tree views is chosen over a custom implementation.
Dependents (Systems/Modules that will depend on this change):
Reporting/Analytics: Any reporting or analytics that uses feature data will need to be updated to correctly interpret hierarchical data (e.g., count features at different levels, aggregate data up the hierarchy).
Search Functionality: Search results may need to indicate the hierarchical position of a feature.
Project Management Views: If features are linked to projects or tasks, these views will need to reflect the new structure.
User Documentation: Will require updates to explain the new
